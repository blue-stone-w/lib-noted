Here are library source with notation, such as opencv. I hope my notes can help you learn. I make some changes in these source and won't upload whole lib. For example, I won't upload folder `opencv/doc`, which doesn't contain any source. So you can't install noted-source. Besides, these lib dource can be too old. 

### 1. opencv
