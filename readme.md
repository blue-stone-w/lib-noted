Here are library source with notation, such as opencv. I hope my notes can help you learn. 

I make some changes in these source and won't upload whole lib. For example, I won't upload folder `opencv/doc`, which doesn't contain any source. So you can't install noted-source. Besides, these lib dource can be too old. 

There are some material, such as articles(with my note), I hope they can help you.

### 1. opencv
##### 1.1 info
* version: 
##### 1.2 noted files/folders
* epnp: cd modules/calib3d/src/epnp.h, epnp.cpp
* modules/imgproc/src: rotcalipers.cpp, convhull.cpp(part)
